        <h2>The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes</h2>
          <h3>by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle</h3>
          <p>"This may interest you, Lestrade," he remarked, holding it out. "The murder was done with it."</p>
          <p>"I see no marks."</p>
          <p>"There are none."</p>
          <p>"How do you know, then?"</p>
          <p>"The grass was growing under it. It had only lain there a few days. There was no sign of a place whence it had been taken. It corresponds with the injuries. There is no sign of any other weapon."</p>
          <p>"And the murderer?"</p>
          <p>"Is a tall man, left-handed, limps with the right leg, wears thick-soled shooting-boots and a grey cloak, smokes Indian cigars, uses a cigar-holder, and carries a blunt pen-knife in his pocket. There are several other indications, but these may be enough to aid us in our search."</p>
          <p>Lestrade laughed. "I am afraid that I am still a sceptic," he said. "Theories are all very well, but we have to deal with a hard-headed British jury."</p>
          <p>"Nous verrons," answered Holmes calmly. "You work your own method, and I shall work mine. I shall be busy this afternoon, and shall probably return to London by the evening train."</p>
          <p>"And leave your case unfinished?"</p>
          <p>"No, finished."</p>
          <p>"But the mystery?"</p>
          <p>"It is solved."</p>
          <p>"Who was the criminal, then?"</p>
          <p>"The gentleman I describe."</p>
          <p>"But who is he?"</p>
          <p>"Surely it would not be difficult to find out. This is not such a populous neighbourhood."</p>
          <p>Lestrade shrugged his shoulders. "I am a practical man," he said, "and I really cannot undertake to go about the country looking for a left-handed gentleman with a game leg. I should become the laughing-stock of Scotland Yard."</p>
          <p>"All right," said Holmes quietly. "I have given you the chance. Here are your lodgings. Good-bye. I shall drop you a line before I leave."</p>
          <p>Having left Lestrade at his rooms, we drove to our hotel, where we found lunch upon the table. Holmes was silent and buried in thought with a pained expression upon his face, as one who finds himself in a perplexing position.</p>
          <p>"Look here, Watson," he said when the cloth was cleared "just sit down in this chair and let me preach to you for a little. I don't know quite what to do, and I should value your advice. Light a cigar and let me expound."</p>
